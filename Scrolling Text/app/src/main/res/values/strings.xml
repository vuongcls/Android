        <i>“Some see things</i> as they are, and ask why. I dream of things that never were, and ask why not.” — Robert F. Kennedy
        \n
        \n<i>A fantasy album</i> is an album of music that never was, but perhaps could have been, if the artists had been inclined to (or legally able to) produce and release it.
        \n
        \n<i>A fantasy album</i> is plausible as a concept — a collective effort of different artists to put forward a theme, or an alternative that could coexist with an artist’s real works. It is more than a set of playlists with liner notes. Careful attention is paid to the starting and ending song of each album “side” and the song sequence throughout, in order to re-create the album experience of that time and to put forth a concept.
        \n
        \nBeatles fantasy “Red Album” is an example. It addresses the idea of what the Beatles might have released if they hadn’t broken up — based on their solo releases.
